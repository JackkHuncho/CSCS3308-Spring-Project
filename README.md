4. Application Name
    CrossTune

5. Application Description
    CrossTune makes it extremely simple to share Spotify and Apple Music playlists across platforms bridging the gap 
    between Spotify and Apple Music users. CrossTune allows its users to share their new playlists to other users with 
    ease. This application will convert cross platform playlists to their respective formats, ensuring that songs are 
    matched accurately between Spotify and Apple Music. Whether theyâ€™re discovering new music or sharing their favorite 
    tracks with friends, CrossTune makes the process seamless. 

6. Audience
    The audience is a heterogeneous group of spotify and apple music users, the two most used music streaming platforms. 
    Our target audience is frustrated that they cannot share custom playlists between the two platforms. CrossTune will 
    be a quick and simple way to post their playlists so that both apple and spotify users can better share music across platforms.

7. Vision Statement
    CrossTune will tear down barriers between music platforms to bring society together around music.
