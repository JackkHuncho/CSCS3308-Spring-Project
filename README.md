4. Application Name
CrossTune

5. Application Description
CrossTune makes it extremely simple to share Spotify and Apple Music playlists across platforms bridging the gap between Spotify and Apple Music users. CrossTune allows its users to share their new playlists to other users with ease. This application will convert cross platform playlists to their respective formats, ensuring that songs are matched accurately between Spotify and Apple Music. Whether theyâ€™re discovering new music or sharing their favorite tracks with friends, CrossTune makes the process seamless. 

6. Audience
The audience is a heterogeneous group of spotify and apple music users, the two most used music streaming platforms. Our target audience is frustrated that they cannot share custom playlists between the two platforms. CrossTune will be a quick and simple way to post their playlists so that both apple and spotify users can better share music across platforms.

7. Vision Statement
CrossTune will tear down barriers between music platforms to bring society together around music.

9. Development Methodology
Since this project is scheduled for 4 weeks, we encourage you to use an Agile Methodology. You can also use a hybrid set of practices from different methodologies. For example, you can use Scrum meetings and Kanban boards to track the progress of your project. The important thing is to have a plan and stick to it.

10. Communication Plan
As a team, we will utilize Trello to distribute tasks, coordinate work, and improve collaboration. This will allow us to set and understand what tasks each group member needs to complete and see priorities as well as progress in the project.

Discord will be the main communication for the team. This application allows us to communicate through text and voice effortlessly. It will also allow us to log tasks, documents, and quickly communicate with each other.

11. Meeting Plan
Team Meetings at 10:00 AM Fridays weekly, locations will be TBD weekly modality is TBD depending on availability and conflicts.

TA Meetings at 9:00 AM Thursdays weekly prior to lab. Location will be the lab rooms in person.

12. Use Case Diagram
Create a high-level Use Case Diagram for your application. Your diagram must show at least 6 key features of your application.

This activity should help you identify the end users of the application and the ways they would interact with the system. You can reference the examples covered in class. This will also help you scope out the features of your application. You can refer to this page for more information on how to create a Use Case Diagram.

13. Wireframes
You will create wireframes for each page of the application.

Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations of the user interface of your application. They are used to plan the layout of the application and to communicate the flow of the application to the team. You can use any tool of your choice to create the wireframes. Hand sketched wireframes are also acceptable. You can refer to this for more information on why and how to create wireframes.
