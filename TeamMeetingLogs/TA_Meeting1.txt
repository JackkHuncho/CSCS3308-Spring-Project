Ian going over our lab 9
- Wireframes are completed

Main branch usage
- Front end vs Partial
- Ian mentioned front end branch isn't necessary
- Main branch should be the main branch worked on
- Completed code should be on main, partial changes should be pushed to main so everyone has access
- Small things should be committed to side branch, once completed, can be pushed to main
- Don't push code until it works
