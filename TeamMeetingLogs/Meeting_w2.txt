Went over what each member did
Kendrix - Front End - Database + Registration/Login
Shane - Settings, Profile, Registration Fix
Renner - Spotify API 
James - Playlist Post Template + Wireframse

Went over project board and how each story related to what each member did (See previous)

Went over what each member plans on doing
Shane - Post Function + Profile database (Ian mentioned may need an async code to get it to work)
Kendrix - Test  branch for apple (Apple API without needing the Apple paywall) + Middleman between APIs and Front-End
Renner - Continue Spotify API
James - Assist Shane w/ Post Function

Ian mentioned that we have 30s to allocate stuff so the download maty take longer than expected.
Potential grant from the school involving the Apple Paywall
