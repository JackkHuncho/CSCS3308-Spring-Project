Team Meeting 4/7

Shane went over the test cases for lab 11 regarding register
 - Issue with a black page with the registration failed message popping up instead of the usual red error popup message
 - All 3 test cases are working besides that
 - Will ensure lab 11 gets turned in with everything

James will be working on Part C on lab 11 to complete the 2 more test cases

Renner went over concerns regarding Apple API
 - Apple doesn't allow for authentication even with the developer access (a lot different than Spotify)
 - Will need to look into a work around, potentially consult Ian

Spotifiy Playlist Implementation
 - Intent is to be able to display the playlist onto the home page
 - Shane/James will work on this if there's time
 - spotify developer potential issue: contact Renner
